## Usage

### Fetching Country Data

The country data is fetched from the REST Countries API using the custom hook `useFetchCountries`. The hook manages the data fetching logic and state.

### Shimmer Effect

The `ShimmerEffect` component is used to display a loading shimmer effect while the data is being fetched. This enhances the user experience by providing a visual indication that data is being loaded.

### Searching by Name

The `SearchBar` component allows users to search for countries by their name. The search input updates the displayed country list in real-time.

### Filtering by Region

The `RegionFilter` component enables users to filter the countries by region. This is achieved by selecting a region from a dropdown menu, which then filters the displayed countries accordingly.

### Dark/Light Mode

The `ThemeToggle` component allows users to switch between dark and light modes. The theme preference is managed using the `ThemeContext` and stored in the local storage to persist between sessions.

### Responsive Design

The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it works well on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
